        FTP decrypting tool for TC ver.1.2 (freeware)
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple utility which allows you to decrypt all encrypted FTP passwords
(as well as passwords for firewalls' access) generally stored in Total
Commander wcx_ftp.ini file.

Just open this ini-file for viewing and browse for following entries:
password=        - for FTP servers and firewall passwords;
httppass=        - for firewall password with HTTP access.

Copy  encrypted  password  and then past it into the top text field of
given  decrypting tool. Now press Enter or click on "Decrypt Password"
button.  As  result  you'll see the decrypted password (or maybe error
description in red color if something went wrong) in the bottom of the
tool. That's all.
