   Description

IE-based file viewer plugin for Total Commander

This plugin shuld be used only if the computer is powerful enough, otherwise delays may be
pretty significant. The plugin uses MS WebBrowser control to view files, so it automatically
supports all formats which IE supports. This includes, of course, native to IE file types like
HTML/XML, many MS Office file types if you have the MS Office installed, PDF through AcrobatReader/IE
integration, all the formats Quick View Plus supports if you have the QVP installed, and so on.
Even more, if you enable this plugin to open directories, then in QuickView mode
select a directory, the second panel magically becomes fully functional Windows Explorer 8-)

WARNING: Since HTML and MS Office files can contain macros or scripts, measures must be taken
to prevent possible script/macro viruses from working. By default, scripting is disabled in the IEView.ini file.
If you enable scripting, then make sure a good antivirus program is installed on your system, or DO NOT use
IEView for viewing files of unknown origin that can contain malicious scripts or macros.


   Installation
   ------------

Copy ieview.wlx and ieview.ini files into your Total Commander plugins directory,
and add the following line to [ListerPlugins] section in the wincmd.ini file:

0=C:\wincmd\plugins\ieview.wlx

(Be sure to substitute actual path to the ieview.wlx file!). Restart the Total Commander.

   Known problems and Limitations
   ------------------------------
- May be pretty slow on slow machines, or when there is not enough memory
- When viewing some files with Ctrl+Q, focus may "flee" from the panel. To fix the problem, set appropriate values in the [BlockFocus] section.
- Though in some cases it is possible to edit the file being viewed, changes are not saved.
  In general, there might be some strange behavior if, for example, a Word file is viewed
  and the user opens another instance of the MS Word. But nothing serious, though.
