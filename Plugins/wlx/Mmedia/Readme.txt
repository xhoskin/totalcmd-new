Multimedia Player and Id3tag Viewer Ver 2.50
============================================

This is an extention of my precedent MP3 player lister plugin 
for Total Commander (version 5.50 and above only)

This viewer is always able to display Id3tag v1 and v2 while playing MP3 file
but also can play all media file "Windows Media Player" may recognize
(i.e. : MP3pro file,  M3U playlist, all directshow codec, ...)
You must before add the extension in the "mmedia.ini" file.

Since version 2.10, you have now the choice between MCI, MediaPlayer 6.4+, and WMP 7+ as player.
Since version 2.43, OGG Vorbis comments are shown
(Recommended directshow filter for Ogg Vorbis file : http://tobias.everwicked.com/)

Installation
-------------
1 - copy "mmedia.ini" and mmedia.wlx in your plugin directory
 ( if "mmedia.ini" isn't found in the plugin directory, it will be created
   in the windows path)

2 - add these two lines to your wincmd.ini (in 5.50 and above)
....or use the Lister plugin interface (in 5.51)

[ListerPlugins]
0=C:\wincmd\plugin\mmedia.wlx
     (Change path to your real one )

4 - only for TC 5.5/5.51 users : disable multimedia (avi, wav,...) in lister configuration

5 - eventually, you can add or remove extensions in "mmedia.ini"
two lines are provided
    MMext are files without Id3tag
    MP3EXT are files with Id3tag

Use
-----
'SPACE key' can play or pause
'S' stop playing
'M' mute sound
'X' switch to fullscreen ('ESC' to exit fullscreen)
'Z' switch between 50, 100, 200% video size
AltGr+'Z' switch between fit/100% video size
Ctrl+'N' / Ctrl+'P' : for playlist file (M3U), jump to next/previous file
'N'/'P' : according to lister's shortkey, jump to next/previous file
'+'/'-' : up and down the volume
'F' key can fit the player in the lister's windows or return to previous state
if playing audio file, Visualization is shown (the last you choose in WMP).
if playing video file, you can double click on movie to play it fullscreen

Ctrl+'E' allow edit ID3tag
to edit ID3TagV1, you can now edit the ID3tag while playing song but when saving
tags, the song restart to beginning

to use alternate interface mode
start the lister in QuickView mode and change the interface, it will be saved only for the QV mode

Warning : some extensions cannot be read when you choose MCI as player (you have to remove then)
        in particular M3U from MP3EXT line


Some code come from :
--------------------
Roman Nurik       : MP3Info library
Giancarlo Iovino  : HyperLink static control
Chris Maunder     : MFCGrid Control
Michael Smith <msmith@xiph.org> : OggVorbis file info 
Christian Ghisler : listplug.zip,lister plugin interface 

Remark :
--------
 there is a bug in Total Commander 5.50/5.51 when you load  some files with a multimedia extension. For the first file, 
 the multimedia plugin work but for the next files  the default lister of total commander will be used.
 You got the same with quick view (CTRL+Q) when you jump from one file to another.
 This is corrected in Total Commander 6.0
