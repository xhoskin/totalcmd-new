<p style="text-align:center">
  <span class="h" style="font-size:1.8em">Excellence</span>, version 1.20
</p>

  
<p>
  <span class="h">overview</span> 
  <br>
  This is a <a href="http://www.ghisler.com">Total Commander</a> Lister plugin 
  which displays text and numbers from spreadsheet files created by OpenOffice 
  Calc, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, KSpread and similar programs.
</p>


<p> 
  <span class="h">installation</span>
  <br>
  Before you install the new version, you must remove the old version. I'm sorry, but it 
  is necessary or the plugin will not load newly supported file types. <br>
  <a href="javascript: toggleDiv('remv')">Procedure  &gt;&gt;</a> 
  <div style="display: block; padding-left:40px;" id="remv">
    One way is to open <span class="s i">Configuration</span> menu, then to 
    <span class="s i">Options</span>, <span class="s i">Plugins</span>, then fourth button 
    (<span class="s i">Configure</span>); find Excellence in the list and remove it. Another 
    way is to open <span class="s i">wincmd.ini</span> and find excellence in 
    <span class="s i">[ListerPlugins]</span> section; it is sufficient to remove the "detect 
    string". Actually it is ok to remove the detect string after the installation. That will 
    tell commander to request a new one.
  </div>
  After that, it is time to install the new version...<br>
  <small><small><br></small></small>
  If you have TC version 6.50 or newer, please use automatic installation feature (hit enter on excellence.zip). <br>
  <a href="javascript: toggleDiv('inst')">Installation on older versions &gt;&gt;</a>
  <div style="display: block; padding-left:40px;" id="inst">
    If you have TC from version 5.51 to 6.03a, open <span class="s i">Configuration</span>
    menu, choose <span class="s i">Options</span> and open the <span class="s i">Edit/View</span> 
    page. Click on <span class="s i">Configure internal viewer</span>, 
    then on <span class="s i">LS-Plugins</span> and then on <span class="s i">Add</span>. 
    Find the <span class="s">excellence.wlx</span> file and add it to the list. 
    Close all dialogs.
    <br>
    If you have TC 5.50 then add these two lines to the <span class="s i">[ListerPlugins]</span> 
    section of the <span class="s i">wincmd.ini</span> file: <br>
    <span class="g">
      123=somepath\excellence.wlx<br>
      123_detect=&quot;&quot;  
    </span><br>
    then replace the number (123) with next available number and set path to plugin location.
  </div>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    <!--
    document.getElementById('inst').style.display = 'none';
    document.getElementById('remv').style.display = 'none';
    document.write(" \n");
    //-->
  </script>
</p>


<p> 
  <span class="h">disclaimer</span>
  <br>
  I do not promise this plugin will properly read any type of data from any
  spreadsheet. In fact, I'm pretty sure it won't. If you encounter an error 
  (plugin displays incorrect data, ignores a file or crashes) please send me
  an e-mail describing symptoms and I will try to fix that. If the document is
  reasonably small, please include it as well.

  <span class="h">keyboard shortcuts</span>
  <br>
  <table border="0">
    <tr> 
      <td>Ctrl+C</td>
      <td>copy cell or range of cells to clipboard</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Ctrl+A</td>
      <td>select entire grid; unused areas will not be copied</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>W</td>
      <td>increase column width to fit the text</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>F</td>
      <td>choose font</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Ctrl+Tab or Tab</td>
      <td>display next sheet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</td>
      <td>display previous sheet</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> 
      <td>Ctrl+F</td>
      <td>search for text</td>
    </tr>

      <td>F3</td>
      <td>find next occurrence</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  Default keys for cursor movement and selection are also supported, as well as 
  Lister's default keys ( N, P, 1-9 and Esc ). You can double-click a column header 
  to resize that column. When in Quick View panel, use ] and [ &nbsp; (square brackets)
  to cycle through sheets as Tab key will not be available. 
</p>


<p> 
  <span class="h">non-english characters</span>
  <br>
  In order to properly display unicode characters (cyrillic, extended latin and 
  other), unicode font must be selected. If the plugin does
  not detect one itself, use an option from the popup menu to choose it. For documents
  saved with older versions of excel, you should choose a non-unicode font and a code
  page in which the document was created. 
</p>


<p> 
  <span class="h">text search</span>
  <br>
  Search function is present, and it now works as you would expect it to work. To 
  search for non-english text in tc older then version 7, the plugin needs to display
  its own dialog box. To invoke that, you must enter --- (three dashes) into Lister's
  standard search dialog. Search options should be chosen in the second dialog. 
  <br>
  Aside from Edit menu, search can be started with Ctrl+F or F7 (Find) and F3 or 
  F5 (Find next). Use these to start a search in Quick View panel.

      that doesn't help, sorry. Please e-mail me and it might work in the next version.

  <tr> 
    <td>Q:</td>
    <td>When I load a csv file, everything is crammed into first column. Why?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>A:</td>
    <td>Cells in csv files are supposed to be separated by commas. However, Microsoft Excel puts semicolons between cells. That is why the plugin has two modes - it primarily expects semicolons and will display files according to that. If the file is comma-separated (as it should be), you'll see everything in first column. Hit '4' on your keyboard to switch between two modes.</td>
